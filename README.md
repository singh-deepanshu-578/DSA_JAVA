# DSA Journey in Java 🚀

Welcome to my **DSA Learning Repository**!  
This repository is dedicated to my daily practice and progress in learning **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **Java**.

---

## 📚 About

I have embarked on a focused journey to strengthen my problem-solving skills and Java fundamentals by consistently practicing DSA problems.  
Each day, I will be uploading new code solutions, covering a variety of topics including:

- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Trees
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Recursion
- Sorting and Searching
- And much more!

My goal is not just to solve problems but to deeply understand the underlying concepts and improve with every line of code.

---

## 📈 Progress Tracking

- 🚀 Daily updates through commits and pushes.
- 📖 Consistent learning and practicing to enhance my coding skills.
- ✍️ Well-structured, readable, and optimized Java code.

---

## 🤝 Contributions Welcome

If you find a better or more optimized approach to any of the problems I've solved, feel absolutely free to suggest it!  
I am open to learning new perspectives and improving my solutions based on community feedback.

You can either:

- Open a pull request with your solution/optimization.
- Create an issue to discuss improvements.

Let's learn and grow together! 💬
